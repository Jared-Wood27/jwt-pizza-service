Jared Wood Curiosity Report

I am picking Researching the origin of the Agile movement for my curiosity report.

As background at my current work we have Agile teams and a semi annual free agile training for members of my team and I've actually yet to take the training. I've always wondered what it was about and seeing it mentioned again in this class I think it would be a good idea to learn more about it!

Starting off with what Agile is, it is a term that refers to a methodology so to speak for software development. Some distinctions Agile makes is to focus on individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan. Additionally many other software development processes emerged from the Agile mindset, the most influential and important one being forming cross functional teams between developers, testers, customers, end users, and anyone else who might be helpful.

As to the history of Agile and according to wikipedia, the driving ideals behind it seem to have begun circulating in the 1990's where a number of more lightweight software development processes began to evolve in reaction to the prevaling statgy of the time, waterfall which was known for being overly regulated, planned, and micro-managed. In answering a need for less weight in development strategies, rapid application development (RAD), unified process (UP), dynamic systems development method (DSDM), Scrum, Crystal Clear, extreme programming, and feature-driven development (FDD) to name a few coming from the the 1990's.

In 2001, the Agile process was created and introduced for the first time, it was created and solidified by many leading executives of the various more lightweight software development processes mentioned above, specifically 17 executives split between Extreme Programming, Ruby, Scrum, OOAD, UML, and Test-driven Development. After their conference the Agile Alliance as they called themselves  jointly published the Maniefesto for Agile Software Development. Thus Agile was oficially born and has become a sort of standard for quicker and value producing software development.

Since 2001 some additions had been added as well it seems, starting in 2005 with a group headed by 2 members of the Agile Alliance, they also wrote an addendum of project management principles the PM Declaration of Interdepence (trying to emulate the founding fathers I see). Next in 2009 another group in conjunction with another member of the Agile Alliance wrote an extension of software development priciples titled the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto. For the last update I'll share, in 2011 the Agile Alliance reconvened again and created the Guide to Agile Practices (renamed the Agile Glossary in 2016), an open-source project which serves as a compendium of the current working defintions of agile practices, terms, elements, and other interpretations and experience guidelines.
